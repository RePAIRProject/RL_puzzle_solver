# Preprocessing

Here we focus on the creation and preprocessing of the data **before** computing compatibilities.

## Fragments
The images of the fragments will be resized to $251\times251$ pixels as defined in the compatibility parameters. The fragments will be centered so that the rotation is applied in the center of the squared image containing the fragment.
